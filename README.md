# Android Splash Screen with MotionLayout

This project demonstrates the implementation of a dynamic splash screen using MotionLayout in Android. The XML file defines animations for transitioning between two constraint sets, providing an eye-catching effect. 

## Demo

## Files Included
- `splash_screen_motion_layout.xml`: Defines the MotionScene for the splash screen animation.
- `build.gradle`: Includes project dependencies.

## Requirements
- Android Studio
- Android SDK version 24 or higher

## Usage
1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.

## How It Works
- The MotionLayout animates the scaling and alpha properties of UI elements (`backgroundLayout`, `greenplant`, `whiteplant`) to create a visually appealing splash screen.
- Gradle dependencies ensure compatibility and proper functioning of the app.
